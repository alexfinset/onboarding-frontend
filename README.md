This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 1.Install

```
yarn install
```

## 2.Run

```
yarn start
```

### Backend

- [onboarding backend repository](https://github.com/alexfinset/onboarding-backend)
- Refer to the readme file for further installation instructions.
- Api is available in `./rest/app.rest`. It is recommended to install REST Client for Visual Studio Code

### Objective and Goals

Build a frontend admin app using provided onboarding backend apis. While building this project, you will get a good grasp of React foundations as well as advanced concepts. Don't try to rush your way though this project, but rather focus on understading foundations of React, unfamiliar concepts, and feel free to ask any questions.

### Guidance and Steps

- You need to create a fully functional admin app. A user should be able to signup, signin, view personal profile, dashboard, create, view, update, and delete blog posts.

The boilerplate has all packages you need to successfully complete this task. Feel free to use lodash util methods. Be as creative as you can. Good luck.
